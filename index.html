            Hello everyone ! My name is Catherine and I am a Financial Analyst for an Entertainment Co in Hollywood. Now i crave a career change. Finance and accounting has been my niche
            since college and I am now financed out I have been thinking about changing careers and decided to take this bootcamp course. Wow ! Its completely outside my comfort zone and 
            indeed quite challenging, but determined to give it my best shot. I enjoying travelling and hope to check off a lot of places off my list.  I was very young when i first travelled 
            on my own and loved it . Other passions include cooking and enjoying different cuisines, I grew up in a family that enjoy gatherings with friends and family enjoying sumptious 
            feasts.

            I like to stay active and spend time outdoors, going on hikes, jogging, sometimes swimming.  Im not the most nimble or flexible, but i do enjoy Yoga and practice it when i need
            some calming work outs.

            The last time i needed a challenge,  i took some German and French language courses..Es war eine wundervolle erfahrung.  Voila! maintenant je veux appredre autre chose !
